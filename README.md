 # AUSTO AUTOMOBILE US EXPANSION ANALYSIS

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
 In the 21st century, cars are an important mode of transportation that provides us the opportunity for personal control and autonomy. In day-to-day life, people use cars for commuting to work, shopping, visiting family and friends, etc. Research shows that more than 76% of people prevent themselves from traveling somewhere if they don't have a car. Most people tend to buy different types of cars based on their day-to-day necessities and preferences. So, it is  essential for automobile companies to analyze the preference of their customers before  launching a car model into the market. Austo, a UK-based automobile company aspires to grow its business into the US market after successfully establishing its footprints in the European market.<br />
 In order to be familiar with the types of cars preferred by the customers and factors influencing  the car purchase behavior in the US market, Austo has contracted a consulting firm. Based on  various market surveys, the consulting firm has created a dataset of 3 major types of cars that are extensively used across the US market. They have collected various details of the car owners which can be analyzed to understand the automobile market of the US
<br />


<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

Austo’s management team wants to understand the demand of the buyers and trends in the US  market. They want to build customer profiles based on the analysis to identify new purchase opportunities so that they can manipulate the business strategy and production to meet certain demand levels. Further, the analysis will be a good way for management to understand the dynamics of a new market. As a Data Analyst working at Aileadtech consulting firm that has been contracted by Austo, I was given the task to create buyer’s profiles for different types of cars with the available data as well as a set of recommendations for Austo. Perform a detailed 
data analysis and create a dashboard using Power BI to generate useful insights that will help the automobile company to grow its business.</b>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

Based on the insights generated, here are my recommendations to Austo Automobile for the US business expansion:

- Scaling-up Hatchback Production: Given their popularity and revenue generation, increasing production capacity for hatchbacks could meet the high demand and further boost sales.
- Targeted Marketing Strategies:

    For hatchbacks, focus marketing efforts on young married men aged 22-30, emphasizing affordability and practicality.
    For sedans, target married professionals aged 27-45 with postgraduate education, highlighting comfort and sophistication.
    For SUVs, cater to older professionals aged 35-60, showcasing luxury and performance.
-  Financial Services: Offer tailored financial services such as personal loans or flexible payment options to address the financial needs of each demographic.
-  Price Adjustments: Consider adjusting prices or offering promotions for SUVs to make them more accessible, given their higher average price point.
-   For Customer acquisition and retention/Gaining of Market shares: Develop loyalty programs or incentives for families, especially those with multiple dependents, to encourage purchases.
